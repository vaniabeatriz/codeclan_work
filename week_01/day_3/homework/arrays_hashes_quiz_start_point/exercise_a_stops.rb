#2. Add "Glasgow Queen St" to the start of the array
#3. Add "Polmont" at the appropriate point (between "Falkirk High" and "Linlithgow")
#4. Print out the index position of "Linlithgow"
#5. Remove "Livingston" from the array using its name
#6. Delete "Cumbernauld" from the array by index
#7. Print the number of stops there are in the array?
#8. Show as many ways as you can to return "Falkirk High" from the array?
#9. Reverse the positions of the stops in the array
#10 Print out all the stops using a for loop

# stops.reverse!
